## Introduction

During my internship at Codsoft, I worked on several data science projects that involved real-world data, statistical analysis, and machine learning algorithms. This repository is a collection of those projects, showcasing my approach to solving data-driven problems and my proficiency in various data science tools and techniques.

## IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
- **Description**: The Iris Flower Classification project involves developing a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species based on their physical measurements. The dataset used in this project comes from the well-known Iris dataset, which includes features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for different iris species.

- **Key Features**: 
  - **Data Exploration:** Conduct a thorough analysis of the Iris dataset to understand the distribution of features and the relationships between them.
  - **Feature Engineering:** Although the Iris dataset is already well-structured, explore possible feature scaling or transformation to enhance model performance.
  - **Evaluation:** Use performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the effectiveness of each model.

- **Results**: 
  - The models achieved high classification accuracy, often exceeding 95%, demonstrating strong performance in distinguishing between the three iris species.
  - Analysis revealed that petal length and petal width are the most significant features for classifying iris species. Additionally, visualization of the feature relationships helped in understanding how well the different species are separated in the feature space.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
